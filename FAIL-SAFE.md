# The FAIL-SAFE team
Originally known as **C463 Pod A**, we all worked on the two main Data Analytics projects described under the guidance of Pod Captain **Janet Llinas**. The name 'FAIL-SAFE' came through during the Telecommunications Marketing Analysis project. 
It comes from our last names and the motto that we never _fail_ to meet your marketing needs.  

My teammates and I have made recommendations on LinkedIn to advocate for each other. You can view the recommendations I've received and given [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssaayala1105/details/recommendations/).

Please contact me via the email or LinkedIn listed on my GitHub profile ([alyssarose05](https://github.com/alyssarose05)) if you have any questions about us or our work.
