# COOP Careers Data Analytics Fellowship
From Aug. 2024 to Dec. 2024, I participated in a highly selective fellowship program that admits recent first-generation Pell-grant recipient college graduates. I did the Data Analytics track in NYC and was in cohort C463! 
During two hands-on projects, I gained experience in Tableau, Excel, and SQL through minimal presentations and one-page reports for stakeholders.  

- Gained experience in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling using SQL and Tableau through a 16-week fellowship program while focusing on professional development.
- Mastered data tools, networking, and interviewing within 200+ hours of instruction time from alumni captains with industry experience.

## NYC Housing Authority Evictions Analysis
Cleaned a dataset on NYC Housing Authority evictions from 2017 to 2022 with Marshal and zip code filtering using pivot tables to show our stakeholder, CEO Lisa Bova-Hiatt, 
that at least 11% of Marshals may have risks of bias based on low-income locations, leading to the urgent recommendation of mandatory bias training to alleviate this issue.
