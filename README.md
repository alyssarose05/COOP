# COOP Careers Data Analytics Fellowship
From Aug. 2024 to Dec. 2024, I participated in a highly selective fellowship program that admits recent first-generation college graduates. You can learn more about COOP and see if you qualify [here](https://coopcareers.org/faq).  

I did the Data Analytics track in NYC and was in cohort C463. During two hands-on projects, I gained experience in Tableau, Excel, and SQL by creating minimal presentations and one-page reports for stakeholders with the [FAIL-SAFE team](https://github.com/alyssarose05/COOP/blob/main/FAIL-SAFE.md).  

- Gained experience in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling using SQL and Tableau through a 16-week fellowship program while focusing on professional development.
- Mastered data tools, networking, and interviewing within 200+ hours of instruction time from alumni captains with industry experience.

## Telecommunications Marketing Analysis
- Increased the viewability of a telecommunications company's digital campaigns by 60% through team collaboration to analyze their large-scale media campaign dataset through by cleaning an Excel spreadsheet.
- Provided 3+ data-driven recommendations for campaign copy and publishing strategies for stakeholders by analyzing creative campaign performance across location and messaging strategies as a Creative Analyst at FAIL-SAFE with 9+ Tableau visualizations.
- Increased team productivity by 75% for in-depth discussions and analysis by cleaning and organizing the dataset through Excel-separated audience segments and categorized locations into cities and states.

## NYC Housing Authority Evictions Analysis
- Uncovered the 11% chance of Marshal bias towards low-income areas within the NYC Housing Authority through team collaboration on an evictions dataset from 2017 to 2022 for stakeholder CEO Lisa Bova-Hiatt with Excel and Tableau.
- Revealed the target areas to be Bronx households with <$30,000 annual income by visualizing the evictions dataset with 10 graphs and maps to see how different Marshals handle evictions through Tableau Public.
- Reduced the data's total size by over ~99% by cleaning and filtering the dataset through the removal of incomplete entries and the creation of pivot tables for filtering different columns for analysis.
