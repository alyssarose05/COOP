# COOP Careers Data Analytics Fellowship
From Aug. 2024 to Dec. 2024, I participated in a highly selective fellowship program that admits recent first-generation Pell-grant recipient college graduates. I did the Data Analytics track in NYC and was in cohort C463! 
During two hands-on projects, I gained experience in Tableau, Excel, and SQL through minimal presentations and one-page reports for stakeholders.  

- Gained experience in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling using SQL and Tableau through a 16-week fellowship program while focusing on professional development.
- Mastered data tools, networking, and interviewing within 200+ hours of instruction time from alumni captains with industry experience.

## Telecommunications Marketing Analysis
- Collaborated with a team of four called FAIL-SAFE to analyze a telecommunications company's large-scale media campaign dataset. Utilized Tableau visualizations to identify opportunities for optimization, resulting in $250 for cost per acquisitions, an improved click-through rate of 1.5%, 60% viewability, and $80 viewable cost per thousand.  Recommendations allowed the client to effectively reach more customers through their campaigns.
- Analyzed creative campaign performance across locations and messaging strategies as a Creative Analyst as FAIL-SAFE to provide data-driven recommendations for campaign copy and publishing strategies, demonstrating to stakeholders that device targeting and creative content influenced over 50% of KPI outcomes.
- Cleaned and organized the dataset by separating audience segments and categorized locations into cities and states. These efforts increased team productivity by 75%, which enabled efficient task completion and allowed time for in-depth discussions and analysis.


## NYC Housing Authority Evictions Analysis
- Collaborated with a team of four to present our findings on a dataset of NYC Housing Authority evictions from 2017 to 2022, showing our stakeholder, CEO Lisa Bova-Hiatt, that over ~11% of Marshals may have risks of bias based on low-income locations, if not more.
- Visualized the dataset using Tableau for 10 graphs and maps to come up with final insights for Lisa, making the recommendations heavily focused on managing the Marshals and how they handle evictions.
- Cleaned and filtered the data by removing incomplete entries/rows and creating pivot tables to filter different columns for analysis, reducing its total size by over ~99% while having verified data to focus on the Marshals with.
